## Goal: 
By the end i will understand, predict, and test how every JS data type behaves, how conversions work, where bugs come from, and how to design robust programs that handle real-world messy inputs.

## What you will master (explicit outcomes)

Clear mental model for primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.

Deep understanding of objects and arrays (reference vs value).

Coercion rules: explicit vs implicit conversion; order of operations in expressions.

Equality rules: == vs === behaviors and surprising cases.

Type detection patterns and their limits.

Immutability, identity, copying, and mutation pitfalls.

Practical defensive patterns: validation, normalization, canonical forms.

Design & test habits to avoid type bugs in real apps.
